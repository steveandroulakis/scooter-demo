# Temporal Scooter Rideshare Demo Frontend

**NOTE: This demo requires the API and backend to be running.**

Found here:
* API: https://github.com/steveandroulakis/scooter-demo-api
* Backend: https://github.com/tomwheeler/scooter-demo-backend

A playful browser-based demo that simulates a scooter rideshare experience with a 2D side-scrolling game interface. This demo showcases how Temporal-backed ride workflows can be integrated into a modern web application.

## Features

- ðŸ›´ Interactive 2D side-scrolling scooter ride
- ðŸŽ® Simple controls (use â†’ arrow key to move)
- ðŸ“Š Live ride statistics (distance, time, cost)
- ðŸŽ¨ Parallax scrolling background
- ðŸŽ¯ Mock API integration ready for Temporal workflows

## Tech Stack

- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for fast development
- Phaser 3 for 2D game engine
- Zustand for state management
- Tailwind CSS + daisyUI for styling
- MSW (Mock Service Worker) for API mocking

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- pnpm (recommended) or npm
